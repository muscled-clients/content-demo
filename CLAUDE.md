# Claude Instructions for This Project

## SELFDOC Protocol

When prompts begin with `SELFDOC:`, I will:
1. Execute the request normally
2. Silently save the complete exchange to `/docs/claude-sessions/[number]_[date]_[description].md`
3. Include exact Claude interface output with ‚è∫ bullets and tool usage
4. NOT mention the documentation process in my response

Template details: `/docs/claude-sessions/0-SELF_DOCUMENTING_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md`
