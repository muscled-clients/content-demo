## Full Prompt Series

### Initial Animation Request
```
Producer brief (one paragraph)
I just give you a prompt regarding the new animation. I also give you the producer brief. So the animation is of the 9th slide. The 9th slide is of a new animation where we write a messy code in a block of code. And then at this Claude wave, this passes through the code from left to right. And while it's passing through the code, the messy code gets transformed into a clean, beautifully formatted code. So the wave passes through from left to right. And while passing through the code, the messy code transforms into a clean code with proper formatting, proper styling, like indentation, and all. So the animation is in loop. The animation duration is 8 seconds, and then it gets repeated like every 8 seconds. So the new animation is code transformation. So Claude is formatting the code, which is messy. So when Claude wave passes through, the formatted code comes in. The colors that you will use in this new animation, you will use the apps color. Don't take any colors from yourself, like don't add your own colors. Use the colors of the app, which are already there like blue 400 or blue 500 or blue 600, whatever is available in the app. Don't create your own colors and don't suggest. Use the app theme color.
```

### Issue 1: Remove Effects and Add Color
```
The animation is fine, the layer animation, layer and code transformation animation is fine, but the glitter effect, the sparking glitter effect and the rainbow overlay effect, that's not looking good, so remove that. The one with confetti animation and the overlay rainbow effect, remove those two. And also the colour of the code is in plain white text. It should be in a colourful text, like the variables and all those colouring should be colourful, make it look like a colour, like the VS code colour theme. And also the code is not looking very much complex, so make it complex and a large code, so before transformation it really looks like it's bad and in a very bad condition. And also in the title, add something related to messy, add the word messy.
```

### Issue 2: Scrollbar and Single Run
```
There is still an issue with animation. The color of the text is still white. It should be colorful. And also when the code is structured in a proper way, the height of that block goes out of the viewport and looks messy. So make it scrollable. Like give it a feel of VS code or any code. You can scroll the code and see all the codes. It doesn't have to be dynamic height. You can also give it a fixed height and add a scrollbar so you can see the whole code by scrolling it. Currently there is no scrollbar and it is expanding the height to a much out of the viewport. Like going outside of the screen. So make it like proper and colorful. The code should be colorful. Add some theme in it. Theme in the color. In the code. Other than that, everything is fine.
```

### Issue 3: Animation Loop
```
still there's an issue. actually the code should look like a proper colored theme code and also the animation should run once when we open the slide and stops and don't go back to start and it only runs again when we open that slide again
```

### Issue 4: Content Consistency
```
the code is not looking formatted not only that the code is looking different than the raw code. you have to format the raw code and show it in cleaner way that's the whole point
```

### Issue 5: HTML Rendering
```
Currently, when the transformation effect shows the code that should have a function effect is different. It only shows span, span, span and multiple times span that it doesn't show the formatted code of that draw code.
```

### Issue 6: Terminal UI Revamp
```
I am thinking of revamping the UI of this 9th slide and this text syntax transformation. Maybe what you can do is that look up to the slide 2. The slide tool will have this code typing terminal type interface and left panel from configuration panel. Keep only the main coding type and then show the code in the terminal in the command prompt or whatever it is. First, the raw code and after that type something like "type something of the motivary life" and what is it? Improve the syntax and form of this code. And then it will press enter like an animation and then after that it will give the form of the code at the bottom. He is like that.
```

### Issue 7: Natural Language Command
```
The command, the clock command, it is not found like it should be like a normal English command in a clock type. No, you know a box, clock type box where you type the commands and it gives you results something like that. And also the model is a little bit going too much above. So give some margin on the top and make it ring it down and arrange the text the heading somewhere else.
```

### Issue 8: Title Positioning
```
We are perfect now, it works fine and one more thing about the title. The title is from messy to beautiful and there is something else at the bottom of the title which is hidden by the pop of love. So we will position the title and so that it is properly visible. I would think it is properly visible, we place the title somewhere else, we position it or fix it.
```

### Issue 9: Final Spacing Adjustment
```
Everything is fine now, just accept card title and what you can do is that maybe you may be decrease the margin top you can do from the title because the bottom card of the terminal is going out of the loophole, it's cutting off. Maybe reduce the height of the terminal or reduce the margin top on the heading or something like that.
```

### Final Documentation Request
```
So yeah, that is fine. Now set document the process and all the forms, we want to complete this slide, the last slide, this most important slide. So create a complete self form, self documentation of this whole process, prompting and response and everything. And by keeping the self-documented and the file in context. I'm pasting the path of the sub-document and the template file so you can get an idea of it. content-demo/docs/claude-sessions/0-SELF_DOCUMENTING_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md
```
