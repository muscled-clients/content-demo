- **Description**: Fixing white text issue and adding scrollable container for proper code display

## Full Prompt
```
There is still an issue with animation. The color of the text is still white. It should be colorful. And also when the code is structured in a proper way, the height of that block goes out of the viewport and looks messy. So make it scrollable. Like give it a feel of VS code or any code. You can scroll the code and see all the codes. It doesn't have to be dynamic height. You can also give it a fixed height and add a scrollbar so you can see the whole code by scrolling it. Currently there is no scrollbar and it is expanding the height to a much out of the viewport. Like going outside of the screen. So make it like proper and colorful. The code should be colorful. Add some theme in it. Theme in the color. In the code. Other than that, everything is fine.

⏺ You're absolutely right! The issue is that the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is being overridden by the Tailwind classes. Let me fix the colorful syntax highlighting and add a proper scrollable container with fixed height like VS Code.
