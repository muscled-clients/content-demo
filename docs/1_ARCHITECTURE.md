# Architectural Principles & Concepts

## Core Philosophy
> "Build for the recorder, optimize for the viewer, develop for the maintainer"

This project creates professional, reproducible presentations optimized for video recording while maintaining code quality and extensibility.

## üéØ Fundamental Principles

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
Each module should have a single, well-defined responsibility. Business logic, presentation logic, and state management should be clearly separated. Components should not know about implementation details of other components.

### 2. **Composition Over Inheritance**
Build complex functionality by combining simple, focused components rather than creating deep inheritance hierarchies. Favor small, reusable pieces that can be composed together in different ways.

### 3. **Immutability**
Treat all data as immutable. Never modify existing data structures directly. Always create new versions when changes are needed. This ensures predictable state changes and easier debugging.

### 4. **Type Safety First**
Leverage TypeScript's type system to catch errors at compile time rather than runtime. Define clear contracts between components. Use type guards and discriminated unions for runtime type safety.

### 5. **Performance by Design**
Consider performance implications from the beginning. Design for 60fps animations. Minimize unnecessary computations and re-renders. Use performance profiling to validate assumptions.

### 6. **Declarative Over Imperative**
Describe what the UI should look like for any given state rather than describing how to transition between states. Let the framework handle the how.

### 7. **Fail Fast, Recover Gracefully**
Detect errors early in development. Provide meaningful error messages. Implement proper error boundaries. Never leave the application in an inconsistent state.

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Patterns

### Container/Presenter Pattern
Separate components that manage state and logic (containers) from components that handle presentation (presenters). Containers handle the what and when, presenters handle the how.

### Provider Pattern
Use context providers to share state across component trees without prop drilling. Keep providers focused on specific domains. Avoid giant global state containers.

### Factory Pattern
Create components dynamically based on configuration. Use factories to instantiate the correct component type at runtime. Enable plugin-like extensibility.

### Strategy Pattern
Define families of algorithms and make them interchangeable. Different response types can have different animation strategies. Strategies can be swapped without changing the consuming code.

### Observer Pattern
Components can subscribe to state changes and react accordingly. Use event emitters for loose coupling between components. Enable real-time updates without direct dependencies.

### Command Pattern
Encapsulate requests as objects. Enable undo/redo functionality. Queue and schedule operations. Decouple the sender from the receiver.

## üìê Design Principles

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Every piece of knowledge should have a single, unambiguous representation in the system. Extract common patterns into reusable abstractions. Avoid duplication of logic or data.

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
The simplest solution is often the best. Avoid over-engineering. Start simple and refactor when needed. Complexity should be justified by clear requirements.

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
Don't add functionality until it's actually needed. Avoid speculative generalization. Build for current requirements, not imagined future ones.

### Single Source of Truth
Each piece of data should have one authoritative source. Derived data should be computed, not stored. Avoid synchronization problems by eliminating duplicated state.

### Principle of Least Surprise
Components should behave in ways that users and developers expect. Follow established conventions. Be consistent in naming and behavior. Document any non-obvious behavior.

## üîç SOLID Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle
A class or component should have only one reason to change. Each module should be responsible for one and only one actor.

### Open/Closed Principle
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. New functionality should be added through extension, not by changing existing code.

### Liskov Substitution Principle
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of subclasses without breaking the application. Derived types must be substitutable for their base types.

### Interface Segregation Principle
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. Prefer many specific interfaces over one general-purpose interface.

### Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details.

## üé• Video Production Principles

### Predictable Timing
All animations should have consistent, predictable timing to facilitate video editing. Use standardized duration constants. Avoid random or variable delays.

### Frame-Perfect Animations
Animations should hit exact keyframes for clean cuts in post-production. Consider frame rates when designing animation curves. Ensure smooth transitions at 60fps.

### Visual Consistency
Maintain consistent visual language throughout the presentation. Use a defined color palette and typography scale. Keep spacing and sizing consistent across components.

### Recording-First Design
Design with the final recorded output in mind. Consider how elements will appear on different screen sizes. Ensure text is readable at various resolutions.

### Edit-Friendly Transitions
Design transitions that provide natural cut points for video editing. Include visual or temporal cues for edit decisions. Avoid transitions that are difficult to cut cleanly.

## üöÄ Performance Principles

### Minimize Re-renders
Components should only re-render when necessary. Use memoization strategies appropriately. Avoid passing new object references unnecessarily.

### Lazy Loading
Load components and data only when needed. Split code into chunks for faster initial load. Defer non-critical resources.

### Optimize Bundle Size
Keep the bundle size small for fast loading. Use tree-shaking to eliminate dead code. Analyze bundle composition regularly.

### Virtual Rendering
For long lists, render only visible items. Implement windowing for performance. Recycle DOM nodes when possible.

### Animation Performance
Use GPU-accelerated properties for animations. Avoid animating properties that trigger layout. Prefer transform and opacity changes.

## üîÑ State Management Principles

### Colocate State
Keep state as close to where it's used as possible. Lift state only when necessary for sharing. Avoid premature globalization of state.

### Derived State Over Stored State
Calculate values instead of storing them when possible. Reduce state synchronization issues. Keep the state tree minimal.

### Unidirectional Data Flow
Data should flow in one direction through the application. State changes should be predictable and traceable. Avoid circular dependencies.

### Normalized State
Store data in a normalized form to avoid duplication. Use references instead of nested objects. Enable efficient updates and lookups.

### Optimistic Updates
Update UI immediately for better perceived performance. Handle failures gracefully with rollback. Provide feedback for async operations.

## üé® Animation Principles

### Natural Motion
Use physics-based animations for realistic feel. Consider acceleration and deceleration. Match animations to real-world motion.

### Purposeful Animation
Every animation should have a clear purpose. Guide user attention appropriately. Avoid gratuitous effects.

### Consistent Timing
Use consistent timing across similar interactions. Create a rhythm that users can anticipate. Define standard duration scales.

### Respect User Preferences
Honor system-level animation preferences. Provide options to reduce or disable animations. Ensure accessibility for motion-sensitive users.

### Progressive Enhancement
Core functionality should work without animations. Animations should enhance, not define, the experience. Gracefully degrade on lower-performance devices.

## üß™ Testing Principles

### Test Behavior, Not Implementation
Focus on what the component does, not how it does it. Tests should survive refactoring. Avoid testing internal state or methods.

### Test Pyramid
More unit tests, fewer integration tests, minimal E2E tests. Test at the appropriate level of abstraction. Balance coverage with maintenance cost.

### Test in Isolation
Each test should be independent of others. Tests should not depend on execution order. Mock external dependencies appropriately.

### Descriptive Test Names
Test names should describe what is being tested and expected outcome. Use the Given-When-Then pattern. Make failures self-explanatory.

## üìÅ Project Organization Principles

### Feature-Based Structure
Organize code by feature rather than by file type. Keep related files close together. Enable easy navigation and discovery.

### Clear Module Boundaries
Define clear interfaces between modules. Minimize cross-module dependencies. Use barrel exports to control public APIs.

### Consistent Naming
Use consistent naming conventions throughout. Names should be descriptive and searchable. Avoid abbreviations and acronyms.

### Scalable Architecture
Structure should accommodate growth without major refactoring. New features should have obvious homes. Avoid architectural decisions that limit future options.

## üîê Security Principles

### Defense in Depth
Multiple layers of security controls. No single point of failure. Assume any layer can be compromised.

### Principle of Least Privilege
Grant minimum permissions necessary. Limit scope of access tokens. Regularly audit and revoke unused permissions.

### Secure by Default
Default configurations should be secure. Require explicit opt-in for less secure options. Make the secure path the easy path.

### Input Validation
Never trust user input. Validate on both client and server. Sanitize data before use.

## üìù Documentation Principles

### Self-Documenting Code
Code should be readable without extensive comments. Use descriptive names and clear structure. Comments should explain why, not what.

### Living Documentation
Documentation should evolve with the code. Keep documentation close to the code it describes. Automate documentation generation where possible.

### Documentation as Code
Treat documentation with the same rigor as code. Version control all documentation. Review documentation changes.

## üéØ Decision Framework

When making architectural decisions, consider:

1. **Recording Impact** - Does it improve the video recording experience?
2. **Performance Impact** - Will it maintain smooth 60fps performance?
3. **Maintainability** - Can other developers easily understand and modify it?
4. **Consistency** - Does it follow established patterns in the codebase?
5. **Simplicity** - Is it the simplest solution that meets requirements?
6. **Scalability** - Will it accommodate future growth?
7. **Reliability** - Does it handle edge cases and errors gracefully?
8. **Testability** - Can it be effectively tested?
9. **Accessibility** - Is it usable by all users?
10. **User Experience** - Does it enhance the end user's experience?
